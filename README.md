This program is written in python to calculate Ecludeian and Manahattan Distance without using ML defined libraries
This program uses custom defined user Exception

Steps Performed:
1) It takes inputs from users about the coordinate
2) Check if user has passed proper values. (Integer and both coordinates are of same size)
3) Call Function to calcuate the distance and return the output
